# Dragon Defense

## Idea and your goal
You are a dragon in a center of the circle arena.
Destroy all waves of warriors, knights etc.
Each wave is harder to defeat

## Controls
You can rotate dragon with A and D keys and shoot with spacebar.
At the end of the wave you get some points. You can use them to upgrade your health (1), attack speed (2) or damage (3).

## Strategies

Our team implemented some bots.
You can select your preferred bot from the launcher at the onset of the game.
Of course, you have a possibility to add your own bot with _.class_ using interface _Algorithm_

The game features the following bots:

### Closest Bot
### Fastest Bot
### Group Bot
### Idiot Bot

_This game is the culmination of a collaborative effort by an 8-person team during their first year of Applied Computer Science studies._
